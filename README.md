# Hotel Reservation System
Having an efficient reservation system is essential for the business of a hotel. To achieve this goal, we decide to develop a hotel reservation system. This platform will be developed using Java.

## Major functionalities
Our system is designed for two kinds of users: guests and managers. A guest can use this application to browse rooms' information and show your booking or leaving intention to the hotel manager. At the same time, a hotel manager can also use this system, including creating rooms, deleting rooms, browsing room information, checking room availability, adding, editing, searching, removing a guest, etc.
